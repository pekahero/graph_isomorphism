# graph_isomorphism

Programm "graph_isomorphism.py" takes 2 aruments: first and second graphs. Like examples "graph1.txt" and "graph2.txt".
Then uses 3 algorithms, each checking if they are isomorphic. Algorithms are Bliss, VF2, Lad.

Run from command line: python graph_isomorhpism.py graph1.txt graph2.txt

Output for example graphs:

BLISS:
Graphs are isomorphic.
Time is 0.001001119613647461
VF2:
Graphs are isomorphic.
Time is 0.0009982585906982422
LAD:
Graphs are isomorphic.
Time is 0.0009989738464355469
